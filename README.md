# CakePHP Application Skeleton


A skeleton for creating applications with [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org) 3.x.

The framework source code can be found here: [cakephp/cakephp](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp).

## Sass

Dans webroot/css: $ ./dart-sass/sass sass/sass.scss sass.css --watch



## Update

Since this skeleton is a starting point for your application and various files
would have been modified as per your needs, there isn't a way to provide
automated upgrades, so you have to do any updates manually.

## Configuration

Read and edit `config/app.php` and setup the `'Datasources'` and any other
configuration relevant for your application.

## Layout

The app skeleton uses a subset of [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) (v5) CSS
framework by default. You can, however, replace it with any other library or
custom styles.
